:::

Awkward Array is a library for **nested, variable-sized data**, including arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using **NumPy-like idioms**.

Arrays are **dynamically typed**, but operations on them are **compiled and fast**. Their behavior coincides with NumPy when array dimensions are regular and generalizes when they’re not.
